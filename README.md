# code-with-quarkus Project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Context
CRUD application with Quarkus and library Panache, that write HTTP Services and interact with a PostgreSql database deployed on 
Docker container, process the result, and write the HTTP response.

- In this app we used Hibernate ORM with Panache Repository that focuses on making your entities easy to write in Quarkus.

- For Packaging the application, digit: mvn compile package
  After this, running the application digiting: 
  java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache-repository-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

## Tecnologies used
Extension:
- RestEasy: to write reactive rest service.
- RESTEasy Jackson: help to write rest service.
- JDBC-Postgres: we use Postgres as DB.
- Quarkus Hibernate Panache Repository: Hibernate ORM with Panache library.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/code-with-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
